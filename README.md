**Jellyseerr** is a free and open source software application for managing requests for your media library.
It is a fork of [Overseerr](https://github.com/sct/overseerr) built to bring support for [Jellyfin](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin) & [Emby](https://github.com/MediaBrowser/Emby) media servers!

_The original Overseerr team have been busy and Jellyfin/Emby support aren't on their roadmap, so we started this project as we wanted to bring the Overseerr experience to the Jellyfin/Emby Community!_

## Current Features

- Full Jellyfin/Emby/Plex integration including authentication with user import & management
- Supports Movies, Shows and Mixed Libraries
- Ability to change email addresses for smtp purposes
- Easy integration with your existing services. Currently, Jellyseerr supports Sonarr and Radarr. More to come!
- Jellyfin/Emby/Plex library scan, to keep track of the titles which are already available.
- Customizable request system, which allows users to request individual seasons or movies in a friendly, easy-to-use interface.
- Incredibly simple request management UI. Don't dig through the app to simply approve recent requests!
- Granular permission system.
- Support for various notification agents.
- Mobile-friendly design, for when you need to approve requests on the go!

  (Upcoming Features include: Multiple Server Instances, and much more!)
